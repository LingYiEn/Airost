A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
Losing personal belongings, such as wallets or phones, can be stressful and inconvenient. The Home for Losts project addresses this issue by creating a user-friendly platform for reporting and managing lost items. By integrating a WhatsApp-based chatbot with an inventory management system, the project simplifies the process of tracking and recovering lost belongings.

Users can report lost items by sending a message via WhatsApp, where the chatbot extracts and records item details, including the name, category, and status, into a centralized database. A confirmation message is then sent to the user for verification.
This approach leverages WhatsAppâ€™s familiarity and accessibility, ensuring an efficient and convenient experience for users. 

By organizing lost-and-found records in a structured inventory, the system helps reduce the time and effort involved in recovering items. Home for Losts aims to provide a reliable, accessible solution to streamline lost-and-found processes.
